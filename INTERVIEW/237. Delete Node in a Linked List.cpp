/*
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:

Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9
after calling your function.

struct ListNode
{
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
};

class Solution
{
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode *node)
    {
        node->val = node->next->val;
        node->next = node->next->next;
