# Competitive Programming
The following repo contains the solutions of the good interview question and some famous problems on well-known platforms like - LEETCODE, HACKERANK, GEEKSFORGEEKS, CODECHEF, CODEFORCES, etc.

### How to start Competitive Programming (CP)?
We are going to give you a short description that you should follow to start with competitive programming.  
###### 1. Choose a Programming Language: 
You should have the knowledge of at least one programming language to step into CP. That programming language will be a tool for you or you can say al language for you to build your thought process and convert that into coding for a given problem. It can be anything C, C++, Java, Python or any programming language you are comfortable with.(C++ is the most preferred language in the CP community).

###### 2. Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity: 
You need to find the best solution i.e optimal one learning these two concepts. So dig yourself into these two topics to know how much time and space an algorithm takes to solve a problem.

###### 3. Learn the Fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms: 
DSA is the major part of programming. You need to find out the best algorithm i.e approach and best data structure suitable for your problems. Array, Linked List, Stack, Searching, Sorting etc. all these are part of DSA so learn these two most important fundamentals to start CP.

###### 4. Take the Challenge and Solve Coding Problems:
You need to take part in coding challenges on different coding platforms.[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/),[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com),[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) and alot of platforms are there. Once you practiced some questions start participating in the coding contests.

###### 5. Practice and Do it Regularly: (:star:)
Yesâ€¦do it regularly to be proficient in it. Your consistency is very important to solve the challenges in CP. It would be difficult initially and you might be frozen out seeing some questions, so start from the basics and gradually increase the level but stick on it and participate in different coding competitions.
